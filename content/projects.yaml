          I volunteered to make this website for the local youth center for the Yemeni community in Oakland CA.
          The project was made using GatsbyJS, React, GraphQl and styled with TailwindCSS. The site needed to be cost effective to maintain and had to have a language toggle to display
          Arabic content. The site uses NetlifyCMS for adding content.

      description: 
          I developed the ReactJS frontend for a course project that allows users to authenticate, store and view stored images. Objects 
          in the images are then recognized using the object detection algorithm YOLOV3. The frontend communicated 
          with a backend server via standard rest api. Images are stored in an S3 bucket according to the user pool
          offered by AWS Cognito. AWS Amplify was used hooking into AWS services on the client side. Stock images are pulled from Unsplash via REST api.
