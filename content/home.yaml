  Software engineering is my passion and learning and getting better is what I strive for. I recently graduated 
  with my bachelor's degree from San Jose State University. I recently graduated from San Jose State University with my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.
  I loved school and made some excellent relationships with my professors and peers alike. 
  
  I am looking for an opportunity to show the value I can bring both to your work culture and teams.
  I bring a tremendous amount of experience and pragmatic thinking. Though I am a new grad, I've worked at many places large and small. The result is someone 
  who is very polished and able to contribute right away. I have had opportunities to pursue other career paths but my love of software and tech
  pushed me to becoming a developer.

  I am actively searching for the next lillypad. If you have an opening or know of one. Shoot me a woof!
