          I volunteered to make this website for the local youth center for the Yemeni community in Oakland CA.
          The project was made using GatsbyJS, React, GraphQl and styled with TailwindCSS. The site needed to be cost effective to maintain and had to have a language toggle to display
          Arabic content. The site uses NetlifyCMS for adding content.

          with a backend server via standard rest api. Images are stored in an S3 bucket according to the user pool
