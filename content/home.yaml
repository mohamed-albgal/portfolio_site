tagLine: Striving to get better each day. Eager to learn and master some small domain in the tech landscape.
body: >
  Software engineering is my passion. Learning and getting better is what I strive for. I have polished people skills and work well on a team. I am efficient in tackling
  any issue I've been assigned and perhaps my strongest skill is adapting to any situation.
  
  I am looking for an opportunity to show the value I can bring both to your work culture and teams.
  I bring a tremendous amount of experience and pragmatic thinking. Though I am a new grad, I've worked at many places large and small including managing a small business after high school!
  The result is someone who is very polished and able to contribute right away. I have had opportunities to pursue other career paths but my love of software and tech
  pushed me to becoming a developer.

  I am eager to begin a successful career in tech. If you have an opening or know of one. Shoot me a
